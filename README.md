### Importance of User-Friendly Design in a Booking System
A user-friendly design is crucial in a booking system because it:
- Enhances user satisfaction and increases booking conversion rates.
- Reduces the learning curve for new users, making the application accessible to a wider audience.
- Minimizes errors during the booking process, such as selecting incorrect dates or entering invalid payment details.
- Builds trust and credibility, encouraging repeat users and recommendations.
